The evolution is carried out using the method of lines. The illustrative cases include: the particle in a box and the harmonic oscillator in one and two dimensions. As non-standard examples we evolve two solitons and show the time-dependent solitonic behavior in one dimension and the stabilization of an atomic gas model in two dimensions.
