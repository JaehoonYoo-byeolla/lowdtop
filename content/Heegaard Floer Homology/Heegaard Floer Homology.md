# What is HF?
Nowdays, *Heegaard Floer Homology(HF)* is really powerful tool for the low-dimensional topology especially for dimesion 3 and 4 . In brief, Heegaard Floer homology is a categorification of [[Alexander polynomial]]. 

# Knot Theory Apsect
In knot theory, Heegaard Floer Homology  really important tool. At least, HF can distuing the knots and links. By [Lickorish-Wallace Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lickorish%E2%80%93Wallace_theorem), 3-manifolds can be constructed by the [[Dehn surgery]] which  In special it detects unknot. 

Not only distinguish the links, ***it detects an unknot***. The unknot is the only one knot which bounds disc which implies we can get a lot of information from manifolds. For example, in dimension 4, Michael Freedman's result coming from the finding disc called [[Disc embedding theorem]].

# What made me decide to study
Well, this is quite personal reason. Professor said 
>If you are geo-top graduate student, you should know how to compute Heegaard Floer homology before graduate. When I was graduate student, it was Spectral sequence. 

In fact, the true reason is, I think, we can find the [[Seiberg-Witten Invariant]]  through the HF. Also, there are exotic[^1] 4-manfiolds from the HF obstruction.
