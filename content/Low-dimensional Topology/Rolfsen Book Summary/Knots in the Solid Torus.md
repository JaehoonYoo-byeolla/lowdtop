# (Solid)Torus
$\mathbb{S}^{3}$ and $\mathbb{S}^{2} \times \mathbb{S}^{1}$ are two solid tori
We can decompose $S^{3}$ as two solid tori.

$$\mathbb{S}^{3} = \partial D^{4} = D^{2}\times \mathbb{S}^{1} \cup \mathbb{S}^{1}\times D^{2}$$

For the convenient, let's denote the first one as $U$ and the other one as $V$.
First of all, let's characterize the solid torus. It is a regular tubular neighborhood of a $\mathbb{S}^{1}$. 
Also, the boundary of the solid torus is well-known torus. 


Homologically, we know there are two homology generators of the torus. Those are ==non-mathematically== meridian and the longitude. If we using the universal cover $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, then we can correspond those as $\left(0,1\right)$ and $\left(1,0\right)$ vectors.

Now, I am going to just consider the embedding $i$ of $\mathbb{S}^{1}$, such as $K = i\left(\mathbb{S}^{1}\right) \subset \mathbb{S}^{3}$, especially choose the unknot. (It does not need to be unknot).
# Meridian
## Definition
We called one of the homology generator of $U$, ==a ==***meridian*** $\mu$, which bounds the disc in the $U$.  Also correspond $\mu$ to the $\left(0, 1\right)$ in the universal cover of $U$.

## Property
1. Homotopically, homologically trivial in $U$.
# Longitude
## Definition
We called the other generator of $U$ as ***longitude*** and denote $l$. Correspond $l$ to the $\left(1, 0\right)$ in the universal cover of $U$. 

## Property
1. $l$ is a generator of $H_{1}\left(U\right) = \pi_{1}\left(U\right)= \mathbb{Z}$.
2. $l$ intersects some meridian of $U$ transversally in a single point.

# Meridian is intrinsic and the Longitude is the choice
Any two meridians of $U$ are equivalent by an ambient isotopy of $U$ in $S^{3}$. On the other hand, any two longitudes are equivalent by a homeomorphism of $U$; however, there are infinitely many ambient isotopy classes.


# Preferred Framing
Using [[Linking number|linking number]], we can choose the how much revolutions we need.
