In this page, $Y$ is a closed oriented three-manifold.

# Motivation
One of the effective way to study the object is decompose until the object is realizable. We can classify the closed surfaces through the number of genus.

Okay then , there would be a natural question. 
> Could we decompose 3-manifold using 2-manifolds which are well known?

The answer is yes and through the Heegaard Splitting.
